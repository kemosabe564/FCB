Welcome to the Embedded Systems Laboratory software pack!

For starters cd to the in4073 folder, and read the in4073.c file. This is the quad side.
In the pc_terminal folder exists a sample pc terminal. Study this as well.

After that read the Makefile to find out what rules are available (modify them as you see fit!).
"make upload-run" is the most interesting one as it will compile both sides, upload the code to the quad and execute the pc side.

p.s. If dfu_serial complains about pyserial, you can install it with "pip install pyserial". 
      ("sudo apt-get install python-pip" on debian based if you are also missing pip)
      ("sudo apt-get install python2.7" for dfu-serial)	  
	  
Have fun and remember: Google it before asking the TAs!

## Requirements (Ubuntu 20.04)
* build-essential
* python2
* git (optional)
* pip2 (to install pyserial)
* pyserial (`pip2 install pyserial`)

## Installing pip2 on Ubuntu 20.04
Ubuntu wanted to make it more difficult to install pip2, so it's not downloadable using the package manager.
To install pip2, run:
```
$ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py
$ sudo python2.7 get-pip.py 
```

Next install pyserial by running:
```
$ pip2 install pyserial
```

## Uploading without sudo
To access `/dev/tty` devices on ubuntu you need to be part of the `dialout` group, 
you can add yourself to the group by running:
```
$ sudo adduser YOUR_USER_NAME dialout
```
You need to reboot for the change to take effect.
