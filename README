Welcome to the Embedded Systems Laboratory software pack!

For starters cd to the in4073 folder, and read the in4073.c file. This is the quad side.
In the pc_terminal folder exists a sample pc terminal. Study this as well.

After that read the Makefile to find out what rules are available (modify them as you see fit!).
"make upload-run" is the most interesting one as it will compile both sides, upload the code to the quad and execute the pc side.

p.s. If dfu_serial complains about pyserial, you can install it with "pip install pyserial". 
      ("sudo apt-get install python-pip" on debian based if you are also missing pip)
      ("sudo apt-get install python2.7" for dfu-serial)	  
	  
Have fun and remember: Google it before asking the TAs!
